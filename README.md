# nlp-spam-classifier
NLP is a field of artificial intelligence focused on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. In this project, NLP techniques are used to process and analyze text data, extract relevant features, and build predictive models.The primary objective of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify messages or text documents as either "spam" (unsolicited or unwanted messages) or "ham" (legitimate messages).

For creating the environment and executing the Jupyter Notebook needed for this scenario, open a new terminal and execute the following commands:  

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nlp
/home/$USER/miniconda3/envs/nlp/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name "nlp"
```
